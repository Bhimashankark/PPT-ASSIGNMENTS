    "#### Problem Statement: \n",
    "Built a model to predict the BMI (body mass index) of a person from an image of their  face. This project borrows from another project made to classify the age and gender of  a person using the input of their face, including the weights of a trained model and a  script used to dynamically detect a userâ€™s face with their webcam. In addition to being  an interesting machine learning problem, predicting BMI in this way could be a useful  tool in medical diagnostics. \n",

    "1. Built a model to predict the BMI (body mass index) of a person from an image of their face \n",
    "2. Face Detection is also required. \n",
    "3. Maintain a database to store each and every data. \n"

    "\n",
    "The system for predicting BMI from an image of a person's face and performing face detection can be divided into several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interface: The system should have a user interface that allows users to interact with the application. This could be a web-based interface where users can upload an image or use a webcam for real-time face detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Preprocessing: The uploaded image or video frames from the webcam need to be preprocessed to prepare them for the prediction and face detection steps. Preprocessing may include resizing, normalization, and transformation to convert the images into a suitable format for input to the machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Face Detection: Face detection is a crucial step to locate and extract the face region from the image or video frame. This can be achieved using pre-trained models such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based methods like OpenCV's DNN module or face detection libraries like dlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "BMI Prediction Model: A machine learning model is required to predict the BMI based on the extracted face region. This model should be trained on a labeled dataset of faces with corresponding BMI values. Various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be employed for this task. The model takes the preprocessed face image as input and produces the predicted BMI as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database: A database is needed to store the collected data, including the images, corresponding BMI values, and any additional information such as timestamps. The database should support efficient storage and retrieval of data for future analysis and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Deployment: The trained BMI prediction model needs to be deployed in a production environment so that it can be used for real-time inference. This may involve integrating the model with the user interface and connecting it with the face detection component.\n",
